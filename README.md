# README-Generator

## Description
The goal of this challenge was to create functions using JavaScript to generate a README.md file using node.js in the terminal. When navigating to the directory and file for this project, you are able to type in "node index". After typing in node index, the template questions appear and the user is able to type in their responses. After responding to all questions, a README.md file will then be created and appear in your file structure for the current workspace. Attached below is a screenshot of the User Story and Acceptance Criteria.
